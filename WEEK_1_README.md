### What is Data Analytics
The main goal of Data Analytics is to transform raw data into actionable insights that guide decision making processes within an organization.

Key Responsibilities:
- Data Collection and Preparation:
- - This refers to data which has been retrieved through various means, like databases, external sources, etc, along with the various steps to clean the data to ensure accuracy, non-ambigous data, etc.

- Data Analysis:
- - This refers to the various methods and tools used in order to interpret data, such as machine learning, statistical methods, etc, which would allow the user to identify patterns and trends within the data.

- Data Visualization and Storytelling:
- - This refers to using a platform to visually display data through means of, for instance, graphcs, charts, etc, which allows for ease of explanation and articulation of the data to stakeholders.

The process is more iterative, since it can be frequently revisited whilst the tean is working with a Data Set.

### Analytics Techniques
The three types of Analytics Includes:
- Descriptive Analytics
- Predictive Analytics
- Prescriptive Analytics

# Note ---> Do more research on these 3 topics

### Machine Learning, AI and Deep Learning
#### AI
AI Includes any type of technique where an individual attempts to get a Computer System to imitate Human Behavior, thus meaning that it is possible to prompt the computer to imitate the intelligence of a human which would allow it to output a particular result, however currently it is unable to function at the level of complex reasoning which a normal human mind contains.

#### Machine Learning
Machine learning makes use of Algorithms in order to analyse datasets in order to help you make informed business decisions about the future, such as Recommending the next movie that a customer might wish to watch based on their past activity and the preferences of similar customers. It is a subset of AI

#### Deep Learning
Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning, since it uses complex techniques, which is called Neural Networks, in order to discover and find data in a particular way. It is more used for image, video and sound analyis.


## Data Governance
Data Governance Programs refers to when a business maintains and pursues a high level of quality regarding their data, along with the ability for the business control said data.

## Analytics Tools
Analytics Tools primarily focus on assisting and automating various tasks of a Data Analyst to reduce ambigous data, promote more efficient and healthy workflows, etc. Some of these tools includes Spreadsheet Tools like Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, RStudio which makes use of the R Programming Language, etc.
